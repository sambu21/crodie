// Get the current time and hour
// HINT: you will have to first get the full date and then get the time and hour of the day
// You may explore the use of JS built-in functions





// Create a variable to store your greeting message 



// Based on the hour you get, you need to set the conditions you want your script to check
// in order to render a specific message
// for now we want to say 'Good Morning' if it is earlier than 12PM



// otherwise we want to check if it is earlier than 3PM and let the visitor know
// 'Hey! I think we are in class!'



// For any other time (i.e., later than 3PM, we just want to say 'Welcome'




// This is an example of an if statement, or a conditional statement
// the JS interpreter checks if a conditions is true, if it is then it executes the code
// If the condition is FALSE, then it skips the code and moves onto the next one (i.e., our else if conditional)
// If that second condition is also FALSE then it moves to our last conditional, our else statement
// IF statements always end in an ELSE statement, if you want to give options in-between we always use ELSE IF



// Then, we use the DOM, and calling the 'getElementById( )' method and its innerHTML property to add some HTML for us onto our webpage
// we basically want to show the return result in <h2 id="greeting"></h2>




// In this section of our script, we want to access the values the user entered into our form
// and add them together
// First we declare our variables for the two values


// Now, let's use the DOM now to access a value in our form and show it back to us in an alert( ) box
// First, we'll creatr a function to store the input values into the variables we declared
// We'll enclose that code block in a function, getNumbers( )

    // Store the values from the form into the variables we declared above
 
 



	// Call the getNumbers() function to import the values the user enteres into the form into 
	// this function

	
	
	// We perform our addition on the two values
	function add(num1, num2) {
		return num1 + num2;
	  }
	
	function subtract(num1, num2){
		return num1 - num2;
	}

	function multiply(num1, num2){
		return num1 * num2;
	}
	
	function divide(num1, num2){
		return num1 / num2;
	}

	// Display the result of the calculation
